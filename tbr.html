                    <h3>Deborah Falaye</h3>
                    <p>This is what they deserve. They wanted me to be a monster. I will be the worst
                         monster they ever created.
                        <br>
                        Fifteen-year-old Sloane can incinerate an enemy at will—she is a Scion, a 
                        descendant of the ancient Orisha gods.
                        <br>
                        Under the Lucis' brutal rule, her identity means her death if her powers are 
                        discovered. But when she is forcibly conscripted into the Lucis army on her 
                        fifteenth birthday, Sloane sees a new opportunity: to overcome the bloody 
                        challenges of Lucis training, and destroy them from within.
                        <br>
                        Sloane rises through the ranks and gains strength but, in doing so, risks 
                        something greater: losing herself entirely, and becoming the very monster 
                        that she ahbors.
                        <br>
                        Following one girl's journey of magic, injustice, power, and revenge, this
                         deeply felt and emotionally charged debut from Deborah Falaye, inspired by 
                         Yoruba-Nigerian mythology, is a magnetic combination of A Song of Wraiths 
                         and Ruin and Daughter of Smoke and Bone that will utterly thrill and capture
                          readers.</p>

                    <h2>The Lost Dreamer</h2>
                    <h3>Lizz Huerta</h3>
                    <p>A stunning YA fantasy inspired by ancient Mesoamerica, this gripping debut 
                        introduces us to a lineage of seers defiantly resisting the shifting 
                        patriarchal state that would see them destroyed—perfect for fans of 
                        Tomi Adeyemi and Sabaa Tahir.
                        <br>
                        Indir is a Dreamer, descended from a long line of seers; able to see beyond 
                        reality, she carries the rare gift of Dreaming truth. But when the beloved 
                        king dies, his son has no respect for this time-honored tradition. King Alcan
                         wants an opportunity to bring the Dreamers to a permanent end—an opportunity
                          Indir will give him if he discovers the two secrets she is struggling to keep.
                           As violent change shakes Indir's world to its core, she is forced to make an
                            impossible choice: fight for her home or fight to survive.
                        <br>
                        Saya is a seer, but not a Dreamer—she has never been formally trained. Her mother
                         exploits her daughter's gift, passing it off as her own as they travel from
                          village to village, never staying in one place too long. Almost as if they're
                           running from something. Almost as if they're being hunted. When Saya loses
                            the necklace she's worn since birth, she discovers that seeing isn't her 
                            only gift—and begins to suspect that everything she knows about her life 
                            has been a carefully-constructed lie. As she comes to distrust the only 
                            family she's ever known, Saya will do what she's never done before, go where
                             she's never been, and risk it all in the search of answers.
                        
                        With a detailed, supernaturally-charged setting and topical themes of patriarchal
                         power and female strength, The Lost Dreamer brings an ancient world to life, 
                         mirroring the challenges of our modern one.</p>

                        <br>
                        When Japanese-American Izumi Tanaka learned her father was the Crown Prince of Japan, 
                        she became a princess overnight. Now, she's overcome conniving cousins, salacious press,
                         and an imperial scandal to finally find a place she belongs. She has a perfect bodyguard
                          turned boyfriend. Her stinky dog, Tamagotchi, is living with her in Tokyo. Her parents
                           have even rekindled their college romance and are engaged. A royal wedding is on the

                        Her parents' engagement hits a brick wall. The Imperial Household Council refuses to approve
                         the marriage citing concerns about Izumi and her mother's lack of pedigree. And on top of it
                          all, her bodyguard turned boyfriend makes a shocking decision about their relationship. At

                           over the council. Which means upping her newly acquired princess game.
                        <br>
                        But at what cost? Izumi will do anything to help her parents achieve their happily ever after,
                         but what if playing the perfect princess means sacrificing her own? Will she find a way to 
                         forge her own path and follow her heart? </p>

                    <h3>Roseanne A. Brown</h3>
                    <p>Karina lost everything after a violent coup left her without her kingdom or her throne. Now the
                         most wanted person in Sonande, her only hope of reclaiming what is rightfully hers lies in a 
                         divine power hidden in the long-lost city of her ancestors.
                        <br>
                        Meanwhile, the resurrection of Karina's sister has spiraled the world into chaos, with disaster 
                        after disaster threatening the hard-won peace Malik has found as Farid's apprentice. When they
                         discover that Karina herself is the key to restoring balance, Malik must use his magic to lure
                          her back to their side. But how do you regain the trust of someone you once tried to kill?
                        <br>
                        As the fabric holding Sonande together begins to tear, Malik and Karina once again find

                         on a single, horrifying choice, they each must decide what they value most—a power that could
                          transform the world, or a love that could transform their lives</p>

                    <p>Fans of The Gilded Ones and Children of Blood and Bone will love the second book in an epic
                         fantasy series about a girl who is the key to saving the empire--or its greatest threat.
                        <br>
                        It's been six months since Deka has freed the goddesses and discovered who she really is.
                         There are now wars waging across the kingdom. Otereans now think jatu are traitors to the
                          nation. Deka is called a monster.
                        <br>
                        But the real battle has only just begun and Deka must lead the charge. Deka is tasked with
                         freeing the rest of the goddesses. Only as she begins to free them, she begins to see a 
                         strange symbol everywhere in places of worship and worn on armor. There's something unnatural
                          about that symbol; just looking at it makes Deka lose her senses. Even worse, it seems to
                           repel her powers. She can't command or communicate with the new deathshrieks. In fact, she
                            can't even understand them when they speak.
                        <br>
                        Deka knows freeing the goddesses is just the beginning. She can tell whatever dark force out 
                        is powerful and there is something sinister out there threatening the kingdom connected to 
                        that symbol--something merciless--that her army will need to stop before humanity crumbles.
                         But Deka's powers are only getting stronger...and her strongest weapon could be herself.</p>
